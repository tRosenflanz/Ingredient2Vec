Applying Word2Vec to Cooking Recipes

In this small notebook I have used recipes to create vector representations of recipe ingredients.
Both CBOW and Skipgram Word2vec methods were used to predict ingredients within a recipe based on other ingredients.
Vectors for different ingredients were clustered and visualized using T-SNE with some natural cuisine separations being visible on the graph.

Data from http://www.yummly.com/ was obtained through https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset
